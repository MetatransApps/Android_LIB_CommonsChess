	 * Features which could be implemented:

	 * HIGH PRIORITY
	 * -  Attacked pieces
	 * -  Knights outpost

	 * LOW PRIORITY
	 * -  Connected bishop and queen

	 * -  Fiancheto bishop
	 * -  Fiancheto like caslting and pawn structure but missing bishop
	 * -  Drawing with opposite bishops and pawns only (this is not feature, should be implemented in the search alg)
	 * -  Moved F pawn before and after castling
	 * -  Missing G pawn before and after castling
	 * -  Traps - static (patterns like [bishop on h7 & pawn on g6])
	 * 
	 * IMPLEMENTED
	 * -  Pinned pieces (different cases - BNK, BNQ, BNR etc.)
	 * -  Colour to move - tempo

Winner is minimizing DTZ and the loser is maximizing DTZ

File Types
Syzygy Bases consist of two sets of files,
WDL files (extension .rtbw) storing win/draw/loss information considering the fifty-move rule for access during search,
and DTZ files (extension .rtbz) with distance-to-zero information for access at the root.
WDL has full data for two sides but DTZ50 omitted data of one side to save space. Each endgame has a pair of those types.

Search
During the Search:
With the WDL tables stored on SSD [12] , it is possible to probe the tables at all depths without much slowdown.
They have been tested in Ronald de Man's engine Sjaak (playing on FICS as TrojanKnight(C)) a couple of months quite successfully,
don't probing in quiescence search.
At the Root:
Since pure DTZ50-optimal play (i.e. minimaxing the number of moves to the next capture or pawn move by either side) can be very unnatural,
it might be desirable to let the engine search on the winning moves until it becomes clear that insufficient progress is being made
and only then switch to DTZ-optimal play (e.g. by detecting repetitions and monitoring the halfmove clock) [13].


Ronald de Man in a reply to Nguyen Pham, April 15, 2020 [28] :
Syzygy WDL is double sided, DTZ is single sided.
WDL:
So to know whether a 7-piece position is winning, losing or drawn (or cursed),
the engine needs to do only a single probe of a 7-piece WDL table.
(It may in addition have to do some probes of 6-piece WDL tables if any direct captures are available.)
DTZ:
If the engine needs to know the DTZ value (which is only necessary when a TB root position has been reached),
the probing code may have to do a 1-ply search to get to the "right" side of the DTZ table.
For 6-piece TBs, DTZ is 81.9GB when storing only the smaller side of each table. Storing both sides might require perhaps 240GB.
